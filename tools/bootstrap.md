> [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.

At times to be determined by the release working group, major versions will be frozen and transitioned to _Long Term Support_ (LTS). After a determined period of time, versions in Long Term Support will be deep-frozen and transition to _Maintenance_.

Versions in _Maintenance_ should not have any changes landed, except for:

* **Critical** bug fixes
* **Critical** security updates
* **Important** documentation updates

Unless a change is urgent, _Maintenance_ releases are likely to be made with minimal frequency.
