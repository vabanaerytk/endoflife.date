> [Python](https://www.python.org/) is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.

By default, the end-of-life is scheduled 5 years after the first release, but can be adjusted by the release manager of each branch. The support for Python 2.7 has currently been extended to 2020-01-01. Versions older than 2.7 have reached end-of-life.

Many projects have [pledged to drop support for Python 2.7](https://python3statement.org/) no later than 2020, coinciding with the Python development teamâ€™s timeline for dropping support for Python 2.7.
