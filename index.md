## Suggestion

The reason this site exists is because this information is very often hidden away. If you're releasing something on a regular basis:

1.  List only supported releases.
2.  Give EoL dates/policy if possible.
3.  Hide unsupported releases behind a few extra clicks.
4.  Mention security/active release difference if needed.
