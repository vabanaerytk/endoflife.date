# endoflife.date [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/a4c194ea-370a-436d-b58f-b1b7eadd88a3/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/jovial-bell-4be416/deploys)

Keep track of various EOL dates as they are approaching. Visit <https://endoflife.date> for a list of supported tools.

Inspired by my [rant on twitter](https://twitter.com/captn3m0/status/1110504412064239617) on how various languages get this wrong.

## Suggestion

The reason this site exists is because this information is very often hidden away. If you're releasing something on a regular basis:

1. List only supported releases.
2. Give EoL dates/policy if possible.
3. Hide unsupported releases behind a few extra clicks.
4. Mention security/active release difference if needed.
