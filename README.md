Inspired by my [rant on twitter](https://twitter.com/captn3m0/status/1110504412064239617) on how various languages get this wrong.

## Suggestion

The reason this site exists is because this information is very often hidden away. If you're releasing something on a regular basis:

1. List only supported releases.
2. Give EoL dates/policy if possible.
3. Hide unsupported releases behind a few extra clicks.
4. Mention security/active release difference if needed.
