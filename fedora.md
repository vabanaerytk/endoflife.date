Fedora end of life dates are not typically known far in advance with to-the-day accuracy, but are supported for approximately 13 months.  Fedora tries to release twice a year (about every 6 months) and supports the current (n) and previous (n-1) version.  See [this link](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases) for a list of all releases, and [this link](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Release_Life_Cycle) for more information about the Fedora Release Cycle.    A list of all EOL releases can be found [here](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/End_of_life).
